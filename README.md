TODO:

it would be better write down the twtich developer console settings for bot application,

or you may forget what should do, for the oauth, auth scope and something over IRC server

so far, it just works but not ideal

TODO:
  - bot nick name and developer account name
  - mention, reply or chat message filtering
  - integrated with chat gpt and tts
